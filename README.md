# database_accessing_protocol
A UDP protocol designed to fetch data from the database over the network whose transactions are fully encrypted and it is also man in the middle attack proof


* run the server.py file on the machine where you want your data to be presented and also bind the server to appropriate port and ip

* now copy all other files except server.py on the machine from where you want to access your data


* This program has two verions gui and terminal
  ## Terminal ##
  for operating with terminal version refect to "client-server documentation(1).pdf" file
 
  ## GUI ##
  for gui just run gui.py with python interpreter and everything else will be self explanatory.
  
  
Note - It could be a little trickier for configuering binding ports and ip so see some example online if you don't know what your are doing
